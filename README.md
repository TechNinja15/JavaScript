JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language commonly used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to add functionalities like:

1. Form validation
2. Animations
3. Interactive maps
4. Real-time updates (like chat apps)

JavaScript runs directly in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox), making it essential for frontend development, but it can also be used on the server-side with environments like Node.js.

In Simple Words : 
JavaScript is the language that makes websites interactive and dynamic, like making a button click do something or showing live updates on a page.


01).                        VARIABLE

A variable in JavaScript is a container for storing data values. Think of it like a labeled box where you can keep things like numbers, text, or more complex data.

Syntax : 
let name = "Avneesh";
const age = 18;
var city = "Raipur";

A JavaScript variable is like a name tag you put on a value so you can use it later in your code. You can create variables using var, let, or const depending on the situation.
